I am excited to apply for this job opportunity. With a strong background in developing applications using REACT, NEXT, REACT NATIVE, FIREBASE, and Typescript, 
I found out that I'm the right fit for the requirements you're looking for!
I have experience implementing REACT and REACT NATIVE solutions using FIREBASE, including Firestore, functions, storage, real-time database functionality, and Typescript for type-safe development.
I have a wealth of experience in creating interfaces that are both responsive and user-friendly, improving application performance, and integrating third-party APIs with ease.
I published 8+ websites with REACT, NEXT.JS & Tailwind CSS, and 6+ mobile apps on the App Store & Google Play with REACT NATIVE & FIREBASE.
These projects not only meet client requirements but also exceeded performance expectations.
I am passionate about staying updated with the latest technologies and best practices in the React ecosystem. I am committed to delivering high-quality code that aligns with industry standards and client expectations.
I am eager to bring my expertise in REACT, REACT NATIVE, FIREBASE, and TS to your project and collaborate with you to achieve success. 
I'll help publish your project with advanced tech! lol
I would love to discuss with you how my skills and experiences match your project requirements.
